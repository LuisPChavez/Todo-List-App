# ExpoTemplateForReactNativeUdemyCourse
This is a template for the react native course by Stephen Grider (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/)

To start the project, change your directory to inside the udemy-template folder.
In a terminal in that directory run these commands seperately.

npm install expo-cli --global

npm install

npm start 

A window should pop up on your browser. At the bottom left change the connection to tunnel and scan the QR code with your phone using the Expo app. After you connect, every time you save your phone will automatically receive the new changes and you will be able to see it. 

This covers up to lesson 24, good luck with the rest of the course!!
